Some weights of SegformerForSemanticSegmentation were not initialized from the model checkpoint at nvidia/segformer-b0-finetuned-ade-512-512 and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- decode_head.classifier.bias: found shape torch.Size([150]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([3]) in the model instantiated
- decode_head.classifier.weight: found shape torch.Size([150, 256, 1, 1]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([3, 256, 1, 1]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Using the `WANDB_DISABLED` environment variable is deprecated and will be removed in v5. Use the --report_to flag to control the integrations used for logging result (for instance --report_to none).
WARNING:accelerate.utils.other:Detected kernel version 5.4.210, which is below the recommended minimum of 5.5.0; this can cause the process to hang. It is recommended to upgrade the kernel to the minimum version or higher.
